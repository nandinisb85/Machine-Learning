# Diabetes Prediction Using Random Forest Classifier

This project involves predicting diabetes in patients using a Random Forest classifier. The notebook walks through the steps of data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical attributes. The dataset used includes features like glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and others.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**
   - The dataset is imported and cleaned. Steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical features if necessary, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**
   - A `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn is trained on the preprocessed data. This model is used to classify whether a patient is diabetic or not based on the input features.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Hyperparameters such as `max_features`, `min_samples_split`, and `n_estimators` are optimized using `GridSearchCV` to improve the model's performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - The best model is selected based on cross-validation performance, and its accuracy is evaluated on the test set.

## Required Libraries

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Instructions for Use

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure that all required libraries are installed in your Python environment:

2. **Running the Notebook:**
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Run each cell sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Understanding the Results:**
   - The notebook will output the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model and the final accuracy of the model on the test data.
   - You can experiment with different features, or datasets, or further tweak the hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to building a Random Forest model for diabetes prediction. By following the steps outlined, you can replicate the results or adapt the code for similar classification tasks with different datasets.
