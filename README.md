### README: Diabetes Prediction Project

**Project Title:** Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

**Overview:**  
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on various health metrics. The dataset used contains information such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other diagnostic measurements. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes.

**Project Structure:**
- **Data Exploration:** Initial analysis to understand the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature selection.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizing and scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify the best performing model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model is fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques.
- **Deployment:** The final model is saved and prepared for deployment using joblib or pickle for future predictions.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for improved model accuracy.
- Comparative analysis of multiple machine learning models.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Model evaluation using multiple performance metrics.
