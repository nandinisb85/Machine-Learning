# Machine-Learning
### Overview

This project involves training a Random Forest classifier on a dataset to predict a certain target variable. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of the model's performance.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**
   - The dataset is loaded, and initial data preprocessing steps are performed, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**
   - A `RandomForestClassifier` is used as the base model. The notebook involves fitting the model on the training data and evaluating its performance on the test set.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using `GridSearchCV` to find the best set of parameters for the Random Forest model. Parameters like `max_features`, `min_samples_split`, and `n_estimators` are tuned.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - The best model is selected based on cross-validation performance, and the final model is evaluated on the test set to determine its accuracy.

### Required Libraries
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` 

### Instructions for Use

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure that all required libraries are installed in your Python environment.

2. **Running the Notebook:**
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
   - Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the results.

3. **Understanding the Results:**
   - The best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model will be displayed along with the final accuracy on the test data.
   - You can modify the dataset or hyperparameters as needed to explore different scenarios.

### Conclusion

This notebook serves as a template for training and tuning a Random Forest model. By following the steps provided, you can adapt the code to different datasets or further fine-tune the model's performance.
